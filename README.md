## HyperDockerBuild

This repository offers **specialized Docker containers for compiling HyperHDR**. These images provide a complete, isolated, and consistent build environment, removing the hassle of managing compilation dependencies on your host system.

We provide tailored build environments for:

* **Debian-based distributions** (like Ubuntu) for x64, arm, arm64
* **Fedora** for x64
* **Arch Linux** for x64

Use these containers if you need to **build HyperHDR from source**, customize it, or contribute to its development, ensuring a reliable and reproducible compilation process every time.
